## Movies' Looking Glass: a Reflection of the Modern World

## Abstract
The last century witnessed key social and political events that transformed many facets of human society. Cinema being a way to depict real-life (as many other forms of art), can reflect all those core societal events and changes in terms of  movies’ genres, scenarios, and characters.
The aim of our project is to see whether we can find specific trends, genres and characters for specific historical events in movies. For this we will regroup the countries of origin of the movies by continent or culture (maybe only look at two continents depending on the completeness of our dataset).
We will then search how specific historical events are influencing the movies and whether we can see specific trends and groupments. Examples of such events are:
- World War I: 1914-1918 (see if we have enough data
- World War II: 1939-1945
- Atomic bombing Hiroshima & Nagasaki: 1945
- Decolonialization (Middle East and Asia ~1945, Africa: ~1955)
- McCarthy hearings: 1954
- Vietnam war: 1955 – 1975
- Contraception pill legalization: 1960 
- Assassination Martin Luther King, Jr: 1968 (which would only be specific for the US but might be interesting to look at)
- Moon Landing: 1969
- Summer of love: 1970
- AIDS: 1981
- Fall of the Berlin Wall: 1989
- Introduction of smartphones: ~ 1995
- 9/11: 2001
- Climate Change: ~2000? 

Throughout these events we can analyze the popular movie genres, plots, whether we can see tendencies for main characters, and which actors are being casted.

## Research Questions
- How do we define/find the movies that belong to a specific historical event?
- Do we have a specific question for one historical event?

### What we want to analyze for each historical event
- Create a Keyword Cloud with the most used words in plot summaries.
- How are the genres distributed?
- What are the movie box office revenues?
- How international are the movies? (Look at languages spoken in movies)
- How are the genders of actors distributed? Of main characters?
- How do the ages of actors change due to the event?
- What are the ethnicities of the actors?
- What are the roles of women in the plot summaries? (Keywordsearch: 'working', 'sensitive', etc.), (during and after wars, during emancipation)
- How the image of the typical family change? (Number of children, single mother, etc.)
- How important is the state in everyday life? (Look how many times the influence of the state is mentioned)
- How has the representation of the LGBTQ+ community changed?
- How is mental health portrayed?
- How is the health system represented? Mentioned how many times, as a positive or a negative instance?
- What is the typical main character and the typical villain? (Find the most representative character)





## Proposed Additional Datasets

We will use the dataset ethnicities.wikidata.csv to complete the characters.metadata.tsv from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset. This dataset contains people's ethnicities mapped to their corresponding freebase ID. Since the freebase database is not accessible anymore, we downloaded this data from Wikidata, through https://query.wikidata.org.


## Methods

To be completed before the milestone 3 deadline
