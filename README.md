## Movies' Looking Glass: a Reflection of the Modern World

## Abstract

The 20th century witnessed key social and political events that transformed many facets of human society. Cinema being a way to depict real-life (as many other forms of art), can reflect all those core societal events and changes in terms of  moviesâ€™ genres, scenarios, and characters. Therefore, we would like to see how the movies changed over the years and also bring to our attention the evolution of characters and actors depending on countries, timelines, and sociopolitical frameworks trying to link our results to specific events throughout history.

## Research Questions

- How many movies do we have over the years for a specific genre?
- Which genres are most popular over the years? What are their box office sales?
- How are characters depicted over the years? Is the main character 'strong' and 'powerful', or 'powerless'?
- How do the actors change over the years? Can we find some tendencies when looking at their age or their sex for example.
- How do all these tendencies change if we look at different countries separately?

## Proposed Additional Datasets

We do not plan to add any other dataset than the given CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset.

## Methods



## Proposed Timeline

By Milestone 2 (17.11.2023):
- Clarify our research questions and finish the README.
- Do already most of our analysis and the graphs that go with it.

Milestone 3 (22.12.2023):
- Implement the feedback received from the Assistant, maybe we are lacking some information we did not think about.
- Program a website to present our findings.
- Be done by the 15.12.2023 to have less stress during the last week of classes.
