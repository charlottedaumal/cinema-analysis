## Actors and Characters: Mirrors of Modern Societies

## Abstract

The 20th century witnessed key social/political events that transformed many facets of human societies. The outstanding industrialization and globalization encouraged and drastically increased interactions between different cultures across countries, leading to a remarkable evolution in the understanding, vision, and appreciation of diversity. Cinema being a way to depict real-life (as many other forms of art), all those core societal events/changes have noticeably influenced movies’ genres, scenarios, and characters. Therefore, we would like to bring our attention on the evolution of ethnicities’ representation in characters and actors depending on countries, timelines, and social/political frameworks. After this global analysis, we would focus on one ethnicity and assess its portrayal through movies’ scenarios, genres, or characters/actors’ features, correlating it with movies’ countries, revenues, timeframe, and related social/political circumstances. This would allow us to assess ethnicities’ diversification, inclusion, and appreciation in the movie industry, this being an essential and present topic in contemporary societies.
